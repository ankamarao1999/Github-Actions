# App Launcher - Project Instructions

This project is a modern frontend dashboard for launching application URLs.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Development Mode (Recommended)
This uses a local development server with hot-reloading.
1. Open terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npm install` (first time only).
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Open the link shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Option 2: Simple Open
If you don't want to use Node/NPM, simply double-click the `index.html` file in this folder.

## Features
- **Dynamic Design**: Glow effects and smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Grid**: Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Launcher Links**: Pre-configured for GitHub, Google, and common local development ports (`3000`, `5173`, `8080`).

## Customization
To add your own URLs, open `index.html` and edit the `href` attribute in the `<a class="card">` tags.
